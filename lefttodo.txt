test sometime:
1. Export the Database

From DBeaver or MySQL, you can export your database into files:

SQL dump (recommended)

Right-click your database in DBeaver → Tools → Backup → Export Database (or similar depending on DBeaver version).

Choose SQL as the format (this creates a .sql file with CREATE TABLE, INSERT statements, etc.).

Save the .sql file.

CSV / JSON (optional)

Export individual tables if you want to share only the data.

Right-click a table → Export Data → select CSV, JSON, or Excel.

2. Push to GitHub

Once you have the exported files:

Initialize a Git repository (if not done already):

git init


Add the files:

git add your_database_dump.sql


Commit:

git commit -m "Add MySQL database export"


Push to GitHub:

git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main

3. Optional: Versioning Database Changes

If you want to track changes to the database schema over time (like code versioning):

Consider using migration tools like Flyway or Liquibase.

Commit only the migration scripts to GitHub instead of full SQL dumps. This keeps the repo clean and makes it easier for others to recreate the database.

Key Points

GitHub cannot host live databases, only files representing them.

.sql dumps are the standard way to share MySQL databases.

Avoid sharing sensitive data; sanitize the SQL dump before pushing.
