1. Relational vs. Document Model

Relational (SQL) Limitations:

Fixed Schema: Adding or removing columns requires ALTER TABLE
Scaling: Difficult to scale horizontally across many servers
Mapping: Mismatch between application objects and database tables (ORM problem)
Performance: Complex models often require many expensive JOIN operations

Document (NoSQL) Advantages:
Flexible Schema: Documents in the same collection can have different fields
Self-Contained Data: Related data is stored together, reducing the need for joins





2. JSON Fundamentals
Definition: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data format

Structure:
Objects (Maps): { "key": "value" }
Arrays (Lists): [ "value1", "value2" ]
Nesting: Objects and arrays can be nested to represent hierarchical data





3. Document Databases (e.g., MongoDB)
Storage: Uses JSON or BSON (binary JSON)

Terminology Mapping:
Table (SQL) ≈ Collection (MongoDB)
Row (SQL) ≈ Document (MongoDB)
Column (SQL) ≈ Field (MongoDB)

Distribution Concepts:
Sharding (scalability): Distributes data across multiple servers
Replication (availability): Maintains copies of data on multiple servers





4. Key Concepts
Redundancy: Duplicate data is often stored to avoid joins and improve read performance
Hybrid Models: Modern SQL databases (e.g., MySQL) support JSON columns
CAP Theorem: Trade-off between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance in distributed systems


SQL: Strict schema, tables, joins, ACID, vertical scaling
NoSQL / JSON: Flexible schema, documents, embedded data, horizontal scaling (sharding)
JSON Format: { "key": "value" } for objects, [ ] for lists
