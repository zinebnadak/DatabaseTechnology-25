1. The find() Method
In MongoDB, find() is the equivalent of SQL’s SELECT statement

Syntax:
db.collection.find({ selection }, { projection })

Selection: Equivalent to WHERE
Projection: Equivalent to SELECT [columns]

SQL → MQL Mapping:
SQL Operation	MQL Syntax
SELECT * FROM branch	db.branches.find({})
SELECT city FROM branch	db.branches.find({}, { city: 1, _id: 0 })
WHERE city = 'London'	db.branches.find({ city: "London" })


2. Important Gotchas

_id Field: Every document must have a unique _id. MongoDB creates one automatically if not provided
Case Sensitivity: MQL is case-sensitive (branchNo ≠ branchno)
Nesting: Query nested fields using dot notation in quotes (e.g., "address.city")







3. Query Operators
MQL uses operators prefixed with $ for comparisons and logic

Comparison Operators:
$eq, $ne
$gt, $gte
$lt, $lte
$in

Logical Operators:
$and, $or, $not, $nor
Example: Find properties with rent between 500 and 700

db.property.find({
  rent: { $gte: 500, $lte: 700 }
})








4. Array Operators
MongoDB has special operators for querying arrays:
$size: Match arrays of a specific length

Example: { staff: { $size: 3 } }
$exists: Check if a field exists
$elemMatch: Match multiple criteria against a single element in an array

Final Exam Summary (.txt):
MQL: JSON-like query syntax
find(): Two arguments → (1) filter, (2) projection
Projection: 1 includes a field, 0 excludes it; _id included by default
Operators: Always prefixed with $
