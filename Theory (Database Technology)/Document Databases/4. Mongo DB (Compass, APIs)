1. MongoDB Compass (GUI)
Definition: Free interactive tool for querying, analyzing, and optimizing MongoDB data. Equivalent to Visual Studio or MySQL Workbench for MongoDB.

Key Features:
Visual Schema Exploration: View document structure without writing queries
Query Builder: Drag-and-drop or form-based way to create find() filters
Aggregation Pipeline Builder: Step-by-step visual editor to see transformations at each stage ($match, $group, etc.)
Explain Plan: Shows query execution plan to identify performance issues and indexing needs
Embedded AI: Some versions include AI assistants for generating MQL from natural language

2. Connecting Applications (APIs)

Use: Real-world applications connect via Drivers or APIs, not the console
Connection String: URL-like string to connect code to the database
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
Python & MongoDB: Most common library is PyMongo
MongoDB Atlas: Provides ready-made code snippets to connect applications

3. Deployment & Cloud (MongoDB Atlas)
Atlas: Fully managed cloud database (Database-as-a-Service)
Clusters: Data stored across multiple servers working together

Security:
IP Whitelisting → restrict access to allowed computers
Database Users → username/password authentication

Final Exam Tips: Tooling
Visualize or debug pipelines: Use MongoDB Compass
Connect programs to DB: Use Connection String + Driver (e.g., PyMongo)
