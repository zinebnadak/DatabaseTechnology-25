Document Model and NoSQL (MongoDB & JSON)
This module explains why document databases are used as an alternative to the relational (SQL) model.

1. Limitations of the Relational Model
Fixed Schema: Structural changes require ALTER TABLE and often lead to many NULL values for optional data
Scalability: Hard to scale horizontally by adding more servers
Impedance Mismatch: Applications use objects, databases use tables, requiring complex data mapping
Complexity: Complex models depend on many resource-heavy JOIN operations

2. JSON Fundamentals
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): A lightweight data-interchange format used by document databases

Structure:
Objects (Maps): { "key": "value" }
Nesting: { "key": { "innerKey": "value" } }
Arrays (Lists): [ "val1", "val2" ]
Key Idea: Data that belongs together is stored together in a single structure

3. Document Databases (e.g., MongoDB)
Terminology Mapping:
Table ≈ Collection (list of JSON documents)
Row ≈ Document (single JSON object)

Key Characteristics:
Schema-less: Documents in the same collection can have different fields
Performance: Embedded data reduces joins but increases redundancy
Scalability:
Sharding: Splits data across multiple servers
Replication: Copies data for high availability

4. SQL vs. NoSQL Trade-offs

ACID vs. CAP:
SQL emphasizes ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
Distributed NoSQL systems deal with CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
Hybrid Models: Modern relational databases (e.g., MySQL) support JSON columns, combining structure with flexibility

Fundamental:
The move to NoSQL is driven by the need for flexible schemas and horizontal scalability, which fixed-schema relational tables struggle to provide.
