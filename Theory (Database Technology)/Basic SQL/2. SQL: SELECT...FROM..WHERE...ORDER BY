1. SELECT Basics

Retrieve specific columns:
SELECT column1, column2 FROM TableName;

Retrieve all columns:
SELECT * FROM TableName;




2. DISTINCT

Remove duplicates:
SELECT DISTINCT column FROM TableName;




3. Calculated Columns & Alias

Create a new column and rename it:
SELECT column1, column2, column3*12 AS annualSalary
FROM TableName;




4. Comparison Operators

Greater than, less than, etc.:
SELECT * FROM Staff WHERE salary > 3500;
SELECT * FROM Staff WHERE salary >= 5000 AND salary <= 6000;




5. Compound Conditions

Multiple criteria with OR / AND:
SELECT * FROM Branch WHERE city='London' OR city='Glasgow';

Negation examples:
SELECT * FROM Staff WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 5000 AND 6000;
SELECT * FROM Staff WHERE position NOT IN ('Manager', 'Supervisor');




6. Set Membership

Check multiple specific values:
SELECT * FROM Staff WHERE position IN ('Manager', 'Supervisor');

Negated version:
SELECT * FROM Staff WHERE position NOT IN ('Manager', 'Supervisor');




7. Pattern Matching (LIKE)

% = any sequence of characters
_ = any single character
SELECT * FROM PrivateOwner WHERE address LIKE '%Glasgow%';




8. NULL Handling

Check for missing values:
SELECT * FROM Viewing WHERE comment IS NULL;

Check for present values:
SELECT * FROM Viewing WHERE comment IS NOT NULL;




9. Ordering Results

Single column:
SELECT * FROM Staff ORDER BY salary DESC;

Multiple columns (primary + secondary sort):
SELECT * FROM PropertyForRent ORDER BY type ASC, rent DESC;

String ordering with collation:
ORDER BY column COLLATE latin1_general_cs;




10. Other Notes
- ANSI SQL strings: single quotes '...'
- MySQL also allows double quotes "..."
- BETWEEN includes boundary values
- ASC = ascending, DESC = descending
