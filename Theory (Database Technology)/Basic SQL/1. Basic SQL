SQL (Structured English Query Language)

Query = request for information from a database

SQL is a declarative programming language - unlike imperative languages (Python, C, Java), SQL isn’t about writing step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow.
Instead, you express the logic of the computation without specifying control flow.
In other words, SQL lets you declare your goals, and the database figures out how to achieve them.

Used to create, delete, retrieve and update data
we use ";" after every instruction

SQL has Two major components:
DDL (Data Definition Language) = defining database structure
DML (Data Manipulation Language) = retrieving and updating data

BNF (Backus–Naur Form)
= SQL syntax is a formal way of describing the rules and structure of SQL statements.
It doesn’t execute anything—it just defines what is syntactically valid SQL.

-------------- SQL COMMANDS (obligatory order) --------------

The SELECT statement

structure example:
SELECT [DISTICT | ALL]
{ * | [columnExpression [AS newName]] [,...]}
FROM TableName [alias] [,...]
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY columnList] [HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY columnList]

* = all
DISTINCT = remove dublettes / show the recurring value only once
SELECT	 = Specifies which columns are to appear in output
FROM     = Specifies table(s) to be used
WHERE	 = Filters rows
GROUP BY   = Forms groups of rows with same column value
HAVING	   = Filters groups subject to some condition
ORDER BY   = Specifies the order of the output

Calculated and renamed columns
- example:
SELECT salary * 12 AS annualSalary
FROM Staff;

- salary * 12 is a calculated expression that multiplies each row’s salary by 12.
- AS annualSalary assigns an alias (temporary column name) to the result of that expression in the query output.
- The underlying column, table, and data type remain unchanged.
