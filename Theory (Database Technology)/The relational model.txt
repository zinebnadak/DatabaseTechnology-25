Relational model terminology

- A relation = table with columns and rows
- An attribute = named column of a relation
- A domain (definition) = set of allowable values for one or more attributes

Example: branchNo (attribute), BranchNumbers (Domain Name), charachter: size 4, range B001-B999 (domain definition)

Mathematical definition of a set (sv. mängd)
- collection of objects or values
- objects have no ordering
- duplicates are not allowed
- use "{}" to show the contents of a set ex a set of teachers: {kim, stefan, joakim}
- A subset (delmängd) is a part of a set, for example {Jonas, Therese}

Mathematical definition of a relation
- ex. BranchNumbers = {B001, B002, B003}
- CityNames = {London, Glasgow}

Cartesian product = The Caresin product is the set of all possible pairs where the first element comes from BranchNumbers and the second from CityNames—essentially a Cartesian product.
ex. Consider three sets BranchNumbers, CityNames, PostCodes. Then the Cartesian product Branchnumbers X CityNames X PostCodes is the set of all tuples.

Instances of Branch and staff relations = the actual rows in their tables, each representing a specific branch or staff member with all attribute values filled.

Properties of relations
- the relation name is distinct from all other
