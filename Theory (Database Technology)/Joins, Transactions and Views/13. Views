1. What is a View?
Definition: A virtual relation, or the dynamic result of one or more relational operations on base tables
Virtual Nature: A view does not physically exist as a stored table; it is generated at query time

Purpose:
Security: Hides parts of the database from specific users
Simplicity: Makes complex multi-table operations appear as a single table
Customization: Allows different users to see the same data in different ways

2. Defining and Using Views
Syntax:
CREATE VIEW ViewName [(newColumnNames)] AS subselect
[WITH CHECK OPTION];
View Resolution: Queries on a view are automatically translated into operations on the underlying base tables
Column Names: Columns inherit names from the subselect unless explicitly renamed

3. The WITH CHECK OPTION
Migrating Rows: Rows that enter or leave a view due to an update are called migrating rows
Constraint: WITH CHECK OPTION prevents rows from migrating out of the view
Example: If a view shows only staff in branch 'B003', WITH CHECK OPTION prevents updating a staff member’s branch to 'B002', because the row would disappear from the view

4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Views

Advantages	                                                                        Disadvantages
Data Independence: View remains unchanged even if base tables change	            Update Restrictions: Many views (joins, aggregates) are not updatable
Security: Users see only a subset of data	                                        Structure Restrictions: Not all base table changes are reflected
Reduced Complexity: Simplifies multi-table queries	                                Performance: Complex views can be slow due to on-demand recalculation

Key Takeaways:
- Views are virtual, not physical tables (unless materialized)
- WITH CHECK OPTION enforces integrity by preventing updates that move rows outside the view’s criteria
