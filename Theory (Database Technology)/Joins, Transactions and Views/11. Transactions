1. What is a Transaction?
Definition: An action, or series of actions, carried out by a single user or application program that accesses or changes the contents of the database
Logical Unit of Work: A transaction is a logical unit of work on the database
Transformations: A transaction transforms the database from one consistent state to another, although consistency may be violated during the transaction
Outcomes: A transaction can either be committed (successfully completed) or aborted (failed and rolled back)


2. ACID Properties
To ensure integrity, every transaction must follow the ACID rules:

Property	Meaning
Atomicity	"All or Nothing." Either the entire transaction is performed or none of it is
Consistency	A transaction must transform the database from one consistent state to another
Isolation	Transactions execute independently; partial effects of incomplete transactions must not be visible to others
Durability	Once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and must survive failures


3. Transaction Boundaries (SQL)
You control when a transaction starts and ends using specific commands:
BEGIN TRANSACTION: Marks the start of the logical unit of work
COMMIT: Signals successful completion; all changes are made permanent
ROLLBACK: Signals failure; all changes since the last BEGIN TRANSACTION are undone


4. Concurrency & Recovery
Concurrency Control: Manages simultaneous database operations so they do not interfere with each other
Database Recovery: Restores the database to a correct state after failures (system crash, media failure, software error)


Key TakeAways:
Joins: Relational Algebra symbols vs. SQL (JOIN, NATURAL JOIN, OUTER JOIN)
Existence: Use EXISTS or NOT EXISTS for subquery checks
ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Commands: COMMIT saves, ROLLBACK undoes
