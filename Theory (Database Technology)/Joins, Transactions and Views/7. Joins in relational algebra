1. Cartesian Product (R × S)
Definition: The concatenation of every tuple (row) in relation R with every tuple in relation S
Outcome: Generates all possible combinations between two tables
Key Math: If R has m rows and S has n rows, the product has m × n rows
Limitation: It includes rows where keys do not match (e.g., Client.clientNo ≠ Viewing.clientNo)

2. Theta Join (R ⋈_F S)
Definition: A Cartesian product followed by a Selection operation based on a predicate (F)
Formula: R ⋈_F S = σ_F (R × S)
Predicate (F): Uses comparison operators like =, <, >, ≤, ≥, ≠
Equijoin: A specific Theta join where the predicate (F) only uses the equality operator (=)
Degree: The number of columns in the result is the sum of the columns in R and S

3. Natural Join (R ⋈ S)
Definition: An Equijoin of two relations over all common attributes
Key Feature: Unlike an Equijoin, it eliminates duplicate columns. One occurrence of each common attribute is removed from the result

4. Outer Joins
These are used to preserve data from tables even when there is no match in the other table.
Keep all rows from one or both tables, even if there’s no match in the other table.
Missing values from the table without a match are filled with NULL.

Join Type	Symbol	Fundamental Behavior
Left Outer	R ⟕ S	Includes all tuples from the left relation (R), even if they have no match in S. Missing values are filled with NULL
Right Outer	R ⟖ S	Includes all tuples from the right relation (S), even if they have no match in R
Full Outer	R ⟗ S	Includes all tuples from both relations, matching where possible and using NULLs where no match exists

Take Aways:
- Cartesian Product: Total combinations (m × n)
- Theta Join: Product + Selection (σ)
- Natural Join: Equijoin - Duplicate columns (combines two tables based on all columns that have the same name.)
- Outer Join: Keeps unmatched rows (Left = keep Left, Right = keep Right)
