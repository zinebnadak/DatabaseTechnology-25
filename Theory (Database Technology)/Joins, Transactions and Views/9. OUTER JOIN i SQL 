1. Concept of Outer Joins
Purpose: Unlike Inner Joins, which only return matching rows, Outer Joins include rows that have no matching values in the join columns of the other table
Missing Data: When a match is not found, the columns from the "missing" side of the join are filled with NULL values



2. Types of SQL Outer Joins

SQL Syntax	Functionality
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN	Returns all rows from the left table (R), and matched rows from the right (S)
RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN	Returns all rows from the right table (S), and matched rows from the left (R)
FULL [OUTER] JOIN	Returns rows when there is a match in either the left or right table



3. Practical Example (Status Reports)
A common exam use case for Outer Joins is producing a status report where you need to see all items, even those with no activity (e.g., properties with no viewings)

SQL Example:
SELECT p.propertyNo, p.street, v.viewDate, v.comment
FROM PropertyForRent p
LEFT JOIN Viewing v ON p.propertyNo = v.propertyNo;

Result:
Properties with viewings appear normally
Properties with no viewings (like PG16 or PL94) still appear in the list, but their viewDate and comment columns will show NULL



4. Fundamental Rules

Left vs. Right: TableA LEFT JOIN TableB is logically the same as TableB RIGHT JOIN TableA. The "Left" table is simply the one written first in the FROM clause
Inner vs. Outer:
Inner: Only shows the "intersections" (matches only)
Outer: Shows the "intersections" plus the "leftovers" from one or both sides
Keywords: The word OUTER is often optional in SQL; LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN perform the same operation



Take Aways:
Equijoin: Only rows where A.id = B.id
Natural Join: Equijoin that auto-removes duplicate columns
Left Outer Join: All of table R + matches from table S
