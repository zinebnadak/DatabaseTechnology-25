1. The EXISTS Operator
Purpose: Used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery
True / False: EXISTS returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row; otherwise FALSE
Efficiency: Stops searching as soon as a single match is found
Result Columns: The subquery usually uses SELECT * because column values are irrelevant; only existence matters

2. Correlated Subqueries
Definition: A subquery that refers to a column in the outer query
Execution: Evaluated once for each row in the outer query
Example: Find all staff who work in a London branch

SELECT ...
FROM Staff s
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT *
  FROM Branch b
  WHERE s.branchNo = b.branchNo
    AND city = 'London'
);


3. The NOT EXISTS Operator
Purpose: Returns TRUE only if the subquery returns zero rows
Use Case: Finding "missing" relationships (entities without related records)
Example: List all clients who have not viewed a property

SELECT clientNo, fName, lName
FROM Client c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT *
  FROM Viewing v
  WHERE c.clientNo = v.clientNo
);


4. EXISTS vs. JOIN
JOIN: Use when you need to display columns from both tables in the final output
EXISTS: Use when you only need to filter rows in the first table based on whether related rows exist in the second table


Take Aways:
Operator	    Logic	                When to Use
EXISTS	        Subquery row count > 0	Finding records with a relationship
NOT EXISTS	    Subquery row count = 0	Finding records without a relationship
