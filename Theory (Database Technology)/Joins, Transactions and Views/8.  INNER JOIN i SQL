1. Multi-Table Queries (The Basics)
When to Join: Use a join if the result columns come from more than one table
Basic Syntax: Include multiple tables in the FROM clause and define the relationship in the WHERE clause
Table Aliases: You can give tables shorthand names (aliases) in the FROM clause to shorten the query or resolve name ambiguities

Example:
FROM Client c, Viewing v
WHERE c.clientNo = v.clientNo



2. Inner Join Syntaxes
SQL offers several ways to write the same join. These are equivalent to the Equijoin or Natural Join in relational algebra.

Syntax Type	SQL Example	Notes
Traditional	FROM TableA, TableB WHERE A.id = B.id	Uses WHERE to filter the Cartesian product
JOIN ... ON	FROM TableA JOIN TableB ON A.id = B.id	Explicitly states the join condition
JOIN ... USING	FROM TableA JOIN TableB USING (id)	Works if both tables have the exact same column name
NATURAL JOIN	FROM TableA NATURAL JOIN TableB	Automatically joins on matching names and removes duplicate columns




3. Important Rules for Joins
Qualification: If a column name exists in both tables (e.g., clientNo), you must qualify it with the table name (e.g., Client.clientNo) to avoid errors
Natural Join Constraint: Requires the join columns to have identical names in both tables
Sorting & Grouping: You can use ORDER BY or GROUP BY on columns from any of the joined tables




4. Advanced Join Scenarios
Three-Table Joins: You must provide N-1 join conditions for N tables
Example: To join Branch (b), Staff (s), and Property (p), you need:
WHERE b.branchNo = s.branchNo AND s.staffNo = p.staffNo
Joining Derived Tables: You can join a physical table to a subquery (temporary table) just like a normal table





Example:
SELECT ...
FROM Property p, (SELECT city FROM ...) AS sub
WHERE p.city = sub.city


Key Tip:
For a Natural Join, you do not need to qualify the join column (e.g., just SELECT branchNo instead of s.branchNo) because the duplicate column is automatically eliminated
