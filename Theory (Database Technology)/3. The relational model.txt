---------- Relational model terminology ----------

- A relation = table with columns and rows
- An attribute = named column of a relation
- A domain (definition) = set of allowable values for one or more attributes

Example: branchNo (attribute), BranchNumbers (Domain Name), charachter: size 4, range B001-B999 (domain definition)

Mathematical definition of a set (sv. mängd)
- collection of objects or values
- objects have no ordering
- duplicates are not allowed
- use "{}" to show the contents of a set ex a set of teachers: {kim, stefan, joakim}
- A subset (delmängd) is a part of a set, for example {Jonas, Therese}

Mathematical definition of a relation
- ex. BranchNumbers = {B001, B002, B003}
- CityNames = {London, Glasgow}

Cartesian product = The Caresin product is the set of all possible pairs where the first element comes from BranchNumbers and the second from CityNames—essentially a Cartesian product.
ex. Consider three sets BranchNumbers, CityNames, PostCodes. Then the Cartesian product Branchnumbers X CityNames X PostCodes is the set of all tuples.

Instances of Branch and staff relations = the actual rows in their tables, each representing a specific branch or staff member with all attribute values filled.

Properties of relations
- The relation name is distinct from all other relation names in the schema
- Each cell of the relation contains exactly one (single) value
- Each attribute has a distinct name
- Values of an attribute are all from the same domain
- Each tuple is distinct; there are NO DUPLICATE TUPLES
- Order of attributes OR tuples has no significance

Relational keys:

- Primary key
ONE unique identifier (across time)
is the candidate key that is actually chosen to uniquely identify rows in a table.
Least likely to change SO when selecting one think in the future, bcs the data will change and you need something that is least likely to be duplicated
How to set one: ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY (*the attribute/row you want to set as superkey)

- Candidate key (they candidate to be prime key basically)
is a minimal set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table
when tying to choose primary key we have the/some candidate keys to choose from
Can be just one which will be chosen as primary key

- superkey
consists of candidate keys attributes + potentially some extra attributes
(is one or multiple attributes together forms a key with a unique identity. There is ALWAYS an superkey in a schema bcs there are no duplicates)

- Alternate Keys
the candidate keys that were not chosen as the primary key but could still uniquely identify rows.

- Foreign Key
is a column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, creating a link between the two tables.
can also possibly be the same relation (a table can reference its own primary key, like in a self-referencing relationship)
example order 21 is bought by user 51 in online shop

Relational integrity:
- NULL values
A NULL value represents missing, unknown, or inapplicable data in a table. It’s not the same as 0 or an empty string it literally means the value is undefined.

- Entity Integrity
No part of a candidate key can be empty (NULL). Every row must be uniquely identifiable.

- Referential Integrity
A foreign key must either match an existing candidate key in another (or the same) table, or be completely empty.

- Enterprise Constraints
Extra rules set by users or admins to control the data.

ACID:
Atomicity: Each transaction happens completely or not at all.
Consistency: Transactions always leave the database in a valid state.
Isolation: Transactions don’t interfere with each other.
Durability: Once a transaction is done, its changes are permanent, even if the system crashes.
