----------- Stored Procedures and Triggers -----------
These allow you to embed logic directly into the database, beyond simple queries.




1. Stored Procedures
Definition: A set of SQL commands stored in compiled form in the database to perform a specific function

Benefits:
Performance: The DBMS does not re-interpret the procedure on each call
Usability: Reusable logic for application developers

Parameters:
IN: Input values (default)
OUT: Return values (procedures do not have a standard return)
INOUT: Values that can be modified by the procedure

Execution:
CALL ProcedureName(args);




2. Triggers
Definition: A special type of stored procedure that executes automatically when a database event occurs

Events: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Timing:
BEFORE: Runs before the change (validation)
AFTER: Runs after the change (logging, side effects)

Logic Keywords:
OLD: Data before the change
NEW: Data being inserted or updated




3. Enforcing Integrity with SIGNAL
Purpose: Abort an operation and raise a custom error message
SQLSTATE '45000': Standard code for a user-defined exception

Example Logic:
IF NEW.salary < OLD.salary THEN
  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
  SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary reduction not allowed!';
END IF;




4. The DELIMITER Command
The Problem: SQL normally ends statements with ;. Procedures contain multiple statements, causing premature termination
The Solution: Temporarily change the delimiter while defining the procedure

Syntax:
DELIMITER //

-- define procedure using ; internally

//

DELIMITER ;



Absolute Fundamentals:
- Stored Procedure: Manually executed with CALL
- Trigger: Automatically executed on INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
- Parameters: IN vs OUT vs INOUT
- Exceptions: Use SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' to block invalid data
