1. What is DDL?
Definition: SQL statements used to create, destroy, and modify database objects such as schemas, tables, views, and indexes

Core Commands:
CREATE: Build a new object
ALTER: Change an existing object’s structure
DROP: Permanently delete an object

2. Table Creation (CREATE TABLE)
Syntax: Define the table name followed by columns, data types, and constraints

Common Data Types:
INTEGER: Whole numbers
VARCHAR(size): Variable-length strings
DECIMAL(precision, scale): Exact numeric values (e.g., money)

Constraints:
NOT NULL: Column cannot be empty
PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row
FOREIGN KEY: References a primary key in another table (referential integrity)
DEFAULT: Sets a value when none is provided

3. Modifying and Deleting Tables
ALTER TABLE: Add, remove, or modify columns

Example:
ALTER TABLE Staff ADD email VARCHAR(100);
DROP TABLE: Deletes the table and all its data
RESTRICT: Drop fails if other objects depend on the table
CASCADE: Automatically drops all dependent objects

4. Indexes (CREATE INDEX)
Purpose: Speed up data retrieval, similar to an index in a book

Trade-off:
Pro: Faster searches and queries
Con: Slower inserts and updates because the index must be maintained
Automatic Indexes: Most DBMSs automatically create indexes for Primary Keys and often Foreign Keys

5. Schemas
Definition: A named collection of related database objects

Command:
CREATE SCHEMA Name;
Analogy: A schema is like a folder or container for tables and views


Key Takeaways:
DDL vs. DML: DDL changes structure; DML changes data
Integrity: DDL defines the rules (Primary Keys, Foreign Keys)
Efficiency: Indexes improve performance but increase storage and update cost
