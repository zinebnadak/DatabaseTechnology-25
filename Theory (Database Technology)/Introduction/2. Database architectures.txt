Quick notes/review
- server
- both MySQL and Mongo db will come but more MySQL
- goal in this cousre is to WORK WITH a already availiable database - then next in another course design from the absolute beginning
- Mongo db is a document database
- MySQL is a relational database
- In this course we will mostly work in Conceptual level

Database Approach:
- A database is a structured system for storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently.

- Shared collection of logically related data, designed to meet the info needs of an organization.
- System catalog: provides an description of the data to enable program-data independance. Example data dictionary, metadata
- Logically related data comprises entities, attributes, and relationships  of an orgaization´s information
- The structure of the database is called the schema (basically the database you´ll work with)


Evolution of Databases
- Flat Files -> Hierarchical -> Relational -> Network -> NoSQL -> Cloud & AI

NoSQL
- NoSQL (“Not Only SQL”) uses flexible, schema-less models like documents (often JSON), key-value pairs, and graphs, while MySQL uses fixed tables with strict relational schemas.

Advantages of DBMSs
- Better control of dat redundancy and consistency
- More info from the same amount of data (derivation of new knowledge, easier sharing of data)

- Cumtom views of the data
- Data integrety though constraints
- Built in support of current transactions

- Built-in support for backup and recovery services

Dis - Advantages of DBMSs
- complexity
- * maybe costs of data conversion (transforming data from one format, structure, or type into another so it can be used by a different system or application)

Objectives of database architectures
- all users should be able to access same data
- A users view is immune to changes made in other views
- should be able to change database storage structures without affecting the users views
- should be able to change conceptual structure of database wo affecting all users

Three- level database architecture
1 physical data organisation (database)
2 Internal level (Internal Schema)
3 Conceptual level (Conceptual schema)     <-----  WE WILL WORK MOSTLY HERE
4. External level (user 1 - view 1/ user 2 - view 2/ ...)

Database Languages
- MySQl consists of two parts DDL and DML.

- Data Definition Lanuguage (DDL):
* Used to define a schema or modify an existing one
* Allows us to describe and name entities (i.e tables in a relational database), attributes and relationships required for the application
* plus any associated integrity and security constraints
* All specifications are stored in the system catalog of the database

- Data Manipulation Lanuguage (DML):
* General enquiry facility (query language) of the data
* provides basic data manipulation operations on the data held in the database
* a non-procedural, declarative DML allows user to state WHAT DATA is needed rather than how it is to be retreived

E-R diagrams = a visual model that shows database entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
