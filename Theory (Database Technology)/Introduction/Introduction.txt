---------------

File-based systems:
File-based systems are the pre-database way of storing and managing data.
They rely on plain files (text, CSV, binary, spreadsheets) stored on disk
, with each application managing its own data logic

Data entry and reports --> (Application programs((File handling routines)(File definition))) --> File/s

Database Management System (DBMS):
The software that creates, stores, protects, and allows you to work with data.
DBMS software – MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Database system - ((Data entry and reports)(DBMS)) --> Database

Server
the machine (physical or virtual) that runs the database management system (DBMS) and provides data services to clients over a network.
ex. Discord login server

A database server consists of:
Hardware / OS – CPU, RAM, disk, network
DBMS software – MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
Stored data – the actual databases
Network interface – listens for client requests

Client
someone who uses the servers
Clients don’t touch files. They talk to the DBMS.
