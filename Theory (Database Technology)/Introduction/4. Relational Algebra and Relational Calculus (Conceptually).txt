------------ DML: Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus (theoretical understanding) ------------

Relational Algebra Fundamentally:

Operations: select (filter rows), project (choose columns), join (combine tables), union/intersect/difference (set operations).
Purpose: it tells you exactly how queries work behind the scenes and what’s possible with your data.
It’s the foundation for query optimization and database design reasoning

Relational Calculus Fundamentally TWO flavors:

Tuple relational calculus (TRC): You describe properties of rows you want. E.g., “Give me all patients whose age > 60.”
Domain relational calculus (DRC): You describe properties of individual values (columns) you want.
Purpose: It’s the theoretical foundation behind SQL’s declarative style. SQL is closer to relational calculus than algebra, because you say what you want, not how to get it.


Two most basic operations in RELATIONAL ALGEBRA:

1. Selection (σ) - (lowercase sigma)
What: Pick ROWS that match a condition.
Example: σ_{Age>60}(Patient) → all patients older than 60.
Think: “Filter rows.”

2. Projection (π) - (pi)
What: Pick COLUMNS you need.
Example: π_{Name, Address}(Patient) → only names and addresses.
Think: “Choose columns.”
Selection (Rows): Choosed by definining "σ" (lowercase sigma)
Projection (columns): Choosed by definining and using "π" (pi)

Combo example:
π_{Name, Address}(σ_{Age>60}(Patient)) → names and addresses of patients over 60.
