What the problem was
1. Unknown root password – You didn’t remember the MySQL root password, so normal login (mysql -u root -p) failed.
2. Attempts to run mysqld_safe as root – On macOS Homebrew MySQL 9.x, mysqld_safe refuses to run as root for security reasons. That caused errors and “suspended” processes.
3. mysql_secure_installation failed – Because it tries to log in as root, but your password was unknown, it couldn’t proceed.
The workaround we used:
* Start MySQL in skip-grant-tables mode as your macOS user (not root), which bypasses passwords.
* Login to MySQL and reset the root password.
* Restart MySQL normally with Homebrew.
Now your root login works, so future access is easy.

Routine for the future
To avoid this headache again, follow these steps whenever you start MySQL:
1. Make sure MySQL is running (Homebrew version):
brew services list
brew services start mysql   # if it’s stopped

2. Log in as root (once you’ve set a password):
mysql -u root -p
* Enter your root password.
* If you forget it, use the skip-grant-tables method as your macOS user, not root, to reset it.

3. Optional: create a user for daily work – safer than using root:
CREATE USER 'zineb'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPassword123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'zineb'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
* Then you can just use:
mysql -u zineb -p

4. Stop and start MySQL safely:
brew services stop mysql
brew services start mysql
* Don’t try to run mysqld manually as root unless you really need skip-grant-tables.

5. Backup passwords somewhere safe — avoids the whole reset process.
💡 Quick tip: For a beginner, the simplest routine is:
* Start MySQL with brew services start mysql
* Login with your user (mysql -u zineb -p)
* Check databases and tables
* Do your work
No need to mess with mysqld_safe unless there’s a forgotten root password.
