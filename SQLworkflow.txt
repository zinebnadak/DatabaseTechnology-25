-- bcs I go from python to .sql I need to run this script as a SQL query.
-- I am using PyCharm Community Edition, which doesn't have built-in database tools
-- so writing the file doesn’t run the SQL — it’s just text until you execute it using a database engine.
-- I need to use an external tool (such as MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or SQLite3 command-line tools) to run my .sql file.

Regardless of which database you use: .sql files are plain text in GitHub

When you start a work session:

Task	        Tool	            Done
Open project    PyCharm	            PyCharm
Open DB         connection	        DBeaver
Create/edit     .sql file	        PyCharm
Run             SQL on DB	        DBeaver
Verify          tables/data	        DBeaver
Commit changes  GitHub	            Terminal

--------> Optional: Setting up once for efficiency
Create folders in PyCharm:
- sql/ for scripts
- python/ for integration scripts
- Configure DBeaver to auto-connect on startup.
- Use descriptive file names (e.g., v1_setup.sql, v2_alter_table.sql).
- Keep your .db file in the same repo so Python and DBeaver point to the same path.

WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

(when working with databases in Pycharm + DBeaver + GitHub)

Step 0 — Prep: Open your tools
1. Open PyCharm → open your project folder:
/Users/zineb/Pycharm/September/DatabaseTechnology-25
2. Open DBeaver → ensure your SQLite database connection points to:
/Users/zineb/Pycharm/September/DatabaseTechnology-25/mydatabase.db
3. (Optional) Open Terminal in PyCharm for Git commands.

✅ You now have:
PyCharm → write SQL and Python.
DBeaver → run SQL.
GitHub (through terminal) → version control.

Step 1 — Create or edit your .sql file in PyCharm
1. Write your SQL inside a file
(Tip: keep your .sql files organized in a folders)

Step 2 — Run SQL in DBeaver
1. Confirm your connection is active (no red “X”). If not: right-click → Connect.
2. Right-click your database → SQL Editor → New SQL Script.
3. Open your file: File → Open File → select create_students_table.sql
4. Click the green ▶️ Execute button (or Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter).
5. Check tables in the Database Navigator → Tables → View Data → All Rows. Your database now reflects the changes from your SQL script.

Step 3 — Version control (GitHub)
1. In the PyCharm Terminal:
git status
git add sql/create_students_table.sql
git commit -m "Add create_students_table.sql with initial data"
git push

- This keeps your SQL scripts versioned — so others (or future you) can re-run them anywhere.
- GitHub stores .sql, not .db (unless it’s a demo).

Step 4 — Connect Python (optional, later)
1. When you start mixing SQL with Python:
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("mydatabase.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()
with open("sql/create_students_table.sql") as f:
    cursor.executescript(f.read())
conn.commit()
conn.close()

This lets you:
- Set up the database automatically.
- Populate it from Python scripts.
- Test your app with consistent data.

Step 5 — Organize & iterate
1. Whenever you modify or expand your database:
Create a new SQL file for the change (don’t overwrite old ones).
Add comments at the top:

-- File: add_courses_table.sql
-- Author: Zineb
-- Date: 2025-11-10
-- Purpose: Add new table for courses

Run in DBeaver → Commit → Push.

- Over time, you’ll have a versioned history of your database evolution.
